## Grant Element

Grant element (value) = (Present value of future disbursements) - (Present value of future repayments)
Grant element (percent) = Grant element value / (Present value of future disbursements)

__Face value__ of the loan = declared amount
__Present value__ of the loan = Present value of future disbursements

### Present value of future disbursements

You have to know how the loan is disbursed:

- Lump sum, all at once?
- Equal payments of frequency _x_ over _y_ years?

#### Lump sum
Present value of future disbursement = Face value

#### Equal payments of frequency _x_ over _y_ years

### Present value of future repayments

You have to know how the loan is repaid:

- When:
    - Grace period of _x_ years?
    - Maturity of _x_ years?

- How:
    - Lump sum, all at once
    - Equal Principal Payments

- Discount Rate: 
#### Equal Principal Payments

This means you pay off an equal share of the original amount plus accrued interest for that period.
